EduConnec — Bridging Students and Colleges Seamlessly

EduConnec is a collaborative platform designed to connect students, colleges, and college representatives through interactive events, college walls, and AI-powered discovery. It provides a distraction-free, modern interface for meaningful academic networking and collaboration.

The current version of EduConnec runs entirely on mock data to demonstrate design, structure, and user experience. The team is actively developing real-time backend functionality using Supabase, with the goal of achieving lightning-fast load speeds and dynamic data synchronization. EduConnec is being developed seriously as a long-term project aimed at empowering students and colleges through seamless digital connectivity.
