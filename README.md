EduConnec â€” Bridging Students and Colleges Seamlessly

https://educonnec.vercel.app

EduConnec is a collaborative platform built to connect students, colleges, and college representatives through interactive events, college walls, and AI-powered discovery. The platform is designed to provide a distraction-free, modern interface for meaningful academic networking.

Currently, the website runs entirely on mock data. The team is actively developing real-time backend integration with a focus on lightning-fast performance and a production-grade experience. EduConnec is being built seriously as a long-term project for students and colleges.
